San Diego Code School

Class project: originated from github.com/SanDiegoCodeSchool/fullstack-remote-program/blob/master/WEB102/web102-san-diego-top-spots.md

owner: michaelerobertsjr

testing is proprietary to the school.
to run my version of the code just:
Clone from github
 look in package.JSON for dependencies
This was last run on node v10.15.1
on macOS High Sierra v10.13.6
using VisualStudioCode to edit
iterm for console and chrome for a browser.

License may be held by michaelerobertsjr. I will update as I know more

This code simply reads Names, Descriptions, and Locations of San Diego from a local JSON.
Displays in a table after first converting Locations to google maps links.
Enjoy Alan
